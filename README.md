# CV_Object_Detection
All projects related to object detection using Computer Vision (CV)
This repository contains all my endeavors to use Computer Vision for Object Detection. There are two major projects in this repository. The first uses HAAR Cascade Classifier to detect objects and the second uses YOLO 3 Coco dataset. In both cases I have used pre-trained models.
HAAR Cascade weights are available for download at : https://github.com/anaustinbeing/haar-cascade-files
YOLO3 config files are given in the repository. The YOLO3.weights file can be downloaded at : https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
